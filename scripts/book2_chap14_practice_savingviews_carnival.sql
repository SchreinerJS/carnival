--Converting Your Practice Queries into Views
--It's time to convert some of your report queries into views so that other database developers
-- and application developers can quickly gain access to useful reports without having to write their own SQL.

--Review all of the queries that you wrote for chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11.
--Determine which of those views you feel would be most useful over time.
-- Consider the view itself, or how it could be integrated into another query and/or view.
--If there were several software applications written that access this database 
--(e.g. HR applications, sales/tax applications, online purchasing applications, etc.)
-- which, if any, of your queries should be converted into views that multiple applications would like use?

--Be prepared to discuss, and defend your choices in the next class.
