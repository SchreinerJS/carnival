Intro to Triggers

Practice: Carnival
1. Create a trigger for when a new Sales record is added, set the purchase date to 3 days from the current date.


2.  Create a trigger for updates to the Sales table. If the pickup date is on or before the purchase date, set the pickup date to 7 days after the purchase date. If the pickup date is after the purchase date but less than 7 days out from the purchase date, add 4 additional days to the pickup date. */
